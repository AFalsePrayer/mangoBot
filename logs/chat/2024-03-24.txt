[03-24-2024 @ 00:18:22.948 GMT] afalseplayer: Jmook was successful because no one knows how to deal with a solid sheik, both n0ne and ibdw blew multiple multiple openings against him. As a sheik player i was glad that he was doing well but i was also annoyed that they were losing to (from my perspective) very basic tactics mangoTYPERS
